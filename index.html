        <h2>Rules of the game are:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ul>
